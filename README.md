# Telomere Length and Exercise Study

A biostatistics project analyzing NHANES data from 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 to investigate the relationship between regular exercise and telomere length in aging.

## Objective
Determine if regular exercise has an effect on telomere length in aging populations.

## Methods
- **Data Source**: NHANES 1999-2000 and 2001-2002
- **Analysis**: Logistic regression to predict age
- **Statistical Methods**: Summary statistics for hypothesis testing

## Data
- Telomere length measurements
- Exercise/physical activity data
- Age demographics
